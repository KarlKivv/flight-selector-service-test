# CGI-eesti-2025-test

## Description

This is my solution for the CGI summer internship program. The goal of this project is to create a simple plane seat booking web app, based on the user's preferences. This is done through the use of filters (window seat, more legroom, closer to the isle etc). The backend needs to be done in Java using the Spring Boot framework. There are no restrictions on the frontend side.

## Initial thoughts / TODOs

Simplest way would be to use JSON objects to communicate between front and back.

Store user selections in frontend state, then send all data to backend upon purchase.
